## The Project
This is an interactive resume! You can click some links that will redirect you to my LinkedIn, some projects, the accompanying GitHub pages or check out the accordion in the "About Me" page to get to know me better.


## Limitations
In the project cards I've made a section called "Made with" and buttons with icons on them. This isn't really thought out in regards to accessibility since a screen reader will read them as buttons but only one, the only linking to the GitHub page, is actually clickable. It probably isn't very user friendly either. One button is clickable. Jeez. I just thought it looked nice to do it like this but I should probably change it.

The background color is my favorite color but for accessibility purposes I probably should have made a light and dark mode instead. If it bothers you please let me know.
