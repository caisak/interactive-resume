## The Project


## Limitations
In the project cards I've made a section called "Made with" and buttons with icons on them. This isn't really thought out in regards to accessibility since a screen reader will read them as buttons but only one, the only linking to the GitHub page, is actually clickable. It probably isn't very user friendly either. One button is clickable. Jeez. I just thought it looked nice to do it like this but I should probably change it.
